# kitch-assist
Kitch Assist is an arduino application that automatically regulates the temperature and power of an electric stove when a meal is being prepared. It takes the approximate time of completion from the user and then cuts power to the stove when the time is up. 

## Main Motivation
1. Prevent accidental fires in cases where the user forgets to attend to the meal.
2. Save power costs by ensuring stove doesn't run on forever in such events.
